; Project language file 1 
; For: seanpm2001/Learn-MDL 
; About: 
; I decided to make MDL the main project language file for this >project (Seanpm2001/Learn-MDL) as MDL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the MDL programming language. It only makes sense to MDL the official language for this project. It is getting its own, project language file, starting here.
